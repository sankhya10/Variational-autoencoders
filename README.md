# Variational-autoencoders
The deep convolution neural network encoder and decoder performed on a pokemon datasets 
The main purpose of a dimensionality reduction method is to find the best encoder/decoder pair among a given family. 
In other words, for a given set of possible encoders and decoders, we are looking for the pair that keeps the maximum of information when encoding and, 
so, has the minimum of reconstruction error when decoding.
